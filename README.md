#Backbone.FacetedSearch
----------

A Backbone.JS plugin for making your collections easily filterable by any key:value pair.


##Setup

*  Include Backbone.FacetedSearch.js in your project, after Backbone.js

*  Make your collection facet-searchable:
```js
your_collection = Backbone.FacetedSearchCollection.extend({
    // Add "facets" (keys) to make filterable
    filterFacets: ['key0', 'key1', 'key2'];
  });
```

*  When you populate your collection, call
  `your_collection.initializeFilters()`

*  After calling initializeFilters(), you will see a new wholeCollection object in your collection
  which, as you guessed, is your whole collection.

##Filtering

*  Filters are based on key: value pairs from your models.
  They allow you to select matching models from your collection, and return a filtered collection containing only those models.

*  You can add or remove them one at a time:

  ```js
  your_collection.addFilter({facet: "value"});
  your_collection.removeFilter({whichever: "you want"});
  ```

*  Add an array of facet value pairs at once:

```js
  var filterArray = [
    {facet: "value"},
    {facet: "other value"},
    {facet: "third, different value"}
  ];
  your_collection.addFilters(filterArray);
```

*  Reset and add one (for a single position switch/toggle behaviour)

  ```js
  your_collection.resetAndAddFilter({facet: "value"});

  ```
*  Reset all, and return the whole collection:

  ```js
  your_collection.resetFilters();

  ```
*  When you do addFilter() your collection will trigger a "change" event
  which means that your view will automatically re-render.

  If you don't want that to happen, you can call
  `your_collection.initializeFilters({silent:true});`
  in that case, there will be a "filter" event that is triggered on the collection.



##Filter Lists
*  For a list of potential values, separated by facet:

  ```js
    your_collection.getFilterLists();
  ```
*  When you add or remove a filter on a particular facet, you can call:
  ```js
    your_collection.getUpdatedFilterLists(facet);
  ```
  which will return a list of all the remaining possible filters for all the other facets.
  This is extremely useful when trying to keep select boxes, etc. up to date.
